        <p>My favorite animal is the hammerhead shark, because of their cool shaped head and all the perks of that "weird" head.</p>

    <div class="CenterAlign">
        <p>The "hammer" part of the hammerhead shark is actually called a cephalofoil. the cephalofoil is covered in electro receptors, which all sharks have, but hammerheads have the most because they are spread out across the cephalofoil.
            Some hammerheads even have 360 degree vison because of their Eye placement so they can see all around themself without needing to turn around, and they can also see above and below without having to turn their heads.</p>

    <div class="RightAlign">
        <p>In conclusion my favorite animal is the hammerhead shark, because they can see and hunt better than any other sharks(but there were some parts I left out about them because I dont have enough time, so thats all for now).</p>
